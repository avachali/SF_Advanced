-- 9.0.0   Query Semi-Structured and Structured Data Together
--         This lab will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.
--         Snowflake provides native support for semi-structured data. This
--         module will walk you through the steps to:
--         Explore the JSON-formatted historical weather data in the TRAINING_DB
--         database.
--         Query semi-structured data using SQL dot notation and the FLATTEN
--         table function.
--         Create a secure view that joins JSON data to the TRIPS table.
--         The JSON data consists of historical weather station observation data
--         from numerous sources. The information is provided by NOAA Integrated
--         Surface Database (ISD) on the Registry of Open Data on AWS NOAA
--         Integrated Surface Database (ISD). The dataset includes over 35,000
--         stations worldwide, with some having data as far back as 1901, though
--         the data show a substantial increase in volume in the 1940s and again
--         in the early 1970s. This data set has been loaded in JSON format in
--         the database named TRAINING_DB under the WEATHER schema.

--         You can use SQL dot notation (e.g.,Â station.coord.lat) to extract
--         values from lower levels in the JSON document hierarchy. This allows
--         Snowflake to treat each field as if it were a column in a relational
--         table.
--         In fact, the results look similar to a regular structured data

--         The command above uses the FLATTEN function to extract values into

-- 9.3.0   Create a View for Production

-- 9.3.1   Create a view containing weather data from the station at JFK airport
--         in New York (station ID 74486094789).
--         This statement defines a view named WEATHER_NY_VW. This view
--         calculates the maximum and minimum temperatures observed at JFK
--         Airport in New York after 2015-01-01, and converts the air
--         temperature from celsius to fahrenheit.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW WEATHER_NY_DEV AS

-- 9.3.2   Query the view to verify that it provides the desired data.

-- 9.4.0   Create a Joined View

-- 9.4.1   Run the following statement to create a view joining the WEATHER_VW
--         and TRIPS tables:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW TRIP_WEATHER_VW 
    AS SELECT * FROM CITIBIKE.SCHEMA1.TRIPS T
LEFT OUTER JOIN WEATHER_NY_DEV W 
   ON TO_DATE(T.STARTTIME) = TO_DATE(W.DATE);


-- 9.4.2   Use the view to count the total number of trips per day and the
--         maximum and minimum temperatures on that day.

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS NUM_TRIPS,
    DATE,
    MAX_TEMP_F,
    MIN_TEMP_F
