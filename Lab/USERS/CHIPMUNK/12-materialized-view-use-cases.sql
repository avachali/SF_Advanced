-- 12.0.0  Materialized View Use Cases
--         This lab will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

-- 12.1.0  Cluster a Table Using a Timestamp Column

-- 12.1.1  Set your context.

USE ROLE TRAINING_ROLE;
USE database CHIPMUNK_db;
USE WAREHOUSE CHIPMUNK_QUERY_WH;
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT=TRUE;


-- 12.1.2  Create a table using cloning.

CREATE TABLE CHIPMUNK_db.PUBLIC.weblog CLONE TRAINING_DB.TRAININGLAB.WEBLOG;


-- 12.1.3  Check the clustering quality of the CREATE_MS and METRIC9 columns.

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'WEBLOG' , '(CREATE_MS)');

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'WEBLOG' , '(METRIC9)');

--         Which column is more effectively clustered?

-- 12.1.4  Run a query with a search filter using the column CREATE_MS.

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(TIME_ON_LOAD_MS) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE CREATE_MS BETWEEN 1000000000 AND 1000001000;


-- 12.1.5  View the query profile to check micro-partition pruning.
--         In this case, the micro-partition pruning is very good.
--         TableScan[2] Node Details

-- 12.1.6  Check the clustering quality of the column PAGE_ID.
--         Based on the column name - would you expect it to be well-clustered,
--         or poorly clustered?

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'WEBLOG' , '(PAGE_ID)' );

--         Were you right?

-- 12.1.7  Run a query that filters in the PAGE_ID.
--         Since PAGE_ID is not well-clustered, you would expect the micro-
--         partition pruning to be low.

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(TIME_ON_LOAD_MS) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE PAGE_ID=100000; 


-- 12.1.8  Check the micro-partition pruning in the query profile.
--         TableScan[2] Node Details
--         Note that, as expected, the micro-partition pruning is very low.
--         Record the execution time, and the micro-partition pruning.

-- 12.2.0  Cluster a Table to Improve Query Performance
--         You would like both queries - the one filtered by PAGE_ID and the one
--         filtered by CREATE_MS - to run fast. But running both queries with
--         equally good performance requires using a second copy of the data
--         thatâ€™s organized differently. You can do this easily with
--         materialized views.

-- 12.2.1  Create a materialized view clustered by PAGE_ID.
--         Creating the materialized view with a clustering key causes Snowflake
--         to reorganize the data during the initial creation of the
--         materialized view. Here you will increase the virtual warehouse size
--         so the re-clustering will go faster - but the operation will still
--         take up to 10 minutes. This would be a good time to stretch your legs
--         or refill your coffee.

ALTER WAREHOUSE CHIPMUNK_query_wh set warehouse_size=XLARGE;

CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW MV_TIME_ON_LOAD
    (CREATE_MS,
    PAGE_ID,
    TIME_ON_LOAD_MS)
    CLUSTER BY (PAGE_ID)
AS
SELECT
    CREATE_MS,
    PAGE_ID,
    TIME_ON_LOAD_MS
FROM WEBLOG;


-- 12.2.2  Check clustering efficiency on the PAGE_ID column of the materialized
--         view.

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION ( 'MV_TIME_ON_LOAD' , '(PAGE_ID)' );

--         After the clustering, the average_depth should be around 2 or 3. This
--         is quite an improvement.

-- 12.2.3  Run the query filtered on PAGE_ID against the materialize view.
--         For a proper performance comparison, set the warehouse size back to
--         what it was the first time the query ran.

ALTER WAREHOUSE CHIPMUNK_query_wh set warehouse_size=LARGE;
 
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(TIME_ON_LOAD_MS) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM MV_TIME_ON_LOAD
WHERE PAGE_ID=100000;

--         This example illustrates a substantial improvement in terms of query
--         performance.

-- 12.2.4  Check micro-partition pruning in the query profile.
--         With the materialized view, only one micro-partition was scanned.
--         There was a significant increase in performance as a result.

-- 12.2.5  SHOW materialized views on the WEBLOG table.

SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS ON weblog;


-- 12.3.0  Explore Automatic Transparent Rewrite on Materialized Views
--         The Snowflake query optimizer can exploit materialized views to
--         automatically rewrite/reroute queries made against the source table,
--         to the materialized view.

-- 12.3.1  Use EXPLAIN to see if a command will use a source table or a
--         materialized view.
--         Use explain to check if a query against the original source table
--         will use a materialized view for query performance

EXPLAIN
SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(TIME_ON_LOAD_MS) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE PAGE_ID=100000; 

--         Note that even though the query was against the WEBLOG table, the
--         EXPLAIN plan shows that the materialized view will be scanned.

-- 12.3.2  Run the query.

ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(TIME_ON_LOAD_MS) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE PAGE_ID=100000; 


-- 12.3.3  Check the query profile.
--         Even though the query was against the WEBLOG table, the materialized
--         view was scanned instead.

-- 12.4.0  Materialized Views on External Tables

-- 12.4.1  Create a file format for an external table.
