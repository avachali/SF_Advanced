-- 17.0.0  Data Sharing
--         This lab will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
--         Secure Data Sharing enables account-to-account sharing of data
--         through Snowflake database tables, secure views, and secure UDFs.
--         In this exercise you will learn how to setup two Snowflake accounts
--         for data sharing. The first account will be the data [provider-
--         account] . The second account will be the data [consumer-account].
--         You will then perform the steps to enable sharing selected objects in
--         a database in the [provider-account] with the [consumer-account]. No
--         actual data is copied or transferred between accounts. All data
--         sharing is accomplished through Snowflakeâ€™s unique services layer and
--         metadata store.

-- 17.1.0  Setup Browsers for Data Sharing

-- 17.1.1  Open two browser windows side-by-side.

-- 17.1.2  In browser 1, enter the Snowflake [provider-account] URL, login,
--         navigate to worksheets and load the script into a new worksheet.
--         In this worksheet, you will only execute commands that are surrounded
--         by PROVIDER comments:

-- PROVIDER --


-- 17.1.3  Rename the worksheet to something that contains the word provider.

-- 17.1.4  In browser 2, enter the Snowflake [consumer-account] URL, login,
--         navigate to worksheets and load the script into a new worksheet.
--         In this worksheet, you will only execute commands that are surrounded
--         by CONSUMER comments:

-- 17.1.5  Rename the worksheet to something that contains the word consumer.

-- 17.7.0  The Power Of Secure User-defined Functions For Protecting Shared Data
--         Secure Views And Their Limitations
--         Today, most data sharing in Snowflake uses secure views. Secure views
--         are a great way for a data owner to grant other Snowflake users
--         secure access to select subsets of their data.
--         Secure views are effective for enforcing cell-level security in
--         multi-tenant situations. This includes software-as-a-service (SaaS)
--         providers granting access to each of their customers, while allowing
--         each customer to see only their specific rows of data from each
--         table. However, there is nothing preventing another user from running
--         a SELECT * query against the secure view and then exporting all the
--         data thatâ€™s visible to them.
--         In many situations, allowing a data consumer to see and export the
--         raw data is completely acceptable. However, in other situations, such
--         as when monetizing data, the most valuable analyses are often run
--         against low-level and raw data, and allowing a data consumer to
--         export the raw data is not desirable. Furthermore, when PII and PHI
--         are involved, privacy policies and government regulations often do
--         not permit providing data access to other parties.
--         Perform the next steps on the [provider-account] in browser 1.

-- 17.7.1  The Power Of Secure UDFs
--         Secure UDFs are small pieces of SQL or JavaScript code that securely
--         operate against raw data, but provide only a constrained set of
--         outputs in response to specific inputs. For example, imagine a
--         retailer that wants to allow its suppliers to see which items from
--         other suppliers are commonly sold together with theirs. This is known
--         as market basket analysis.
--         Using the TCP-DS sample data set thatâ€™s available to all users from
--         the Shares tab within Snowflake, we can run the following SQL
--         commands to create a test data set and perform a market basket
--         analysis:

-- PROVIDER --
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CHIPMUNK_udf_demo.public.sales AS
(SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF10TCL.STORE_SALES
 SAMPLE BLOCK (1));

select 6139 as input_item
     , ss_item_sk as basket_Item
     , count(distinct ss_ticket_number) baskets
  from CHIPMUNK_udf_demo.public.sales  
  where ss_ticket_number in 
         (select ss_ticket_number 
             from CHIPMUNK_udf_demo.public.sales 
             where ss_item_sk = 6139)
  group by ss_item_sk
  order by 3 desc, 2;
-- PROVIDER --


-- 17.7.2  Create a Secure UDF
--         This example returns the items that sold together with item #6139.
--         This example outputs only aggregated data, which is the number of
--         times various other products are sold together, in the same
--         transaction, with item #6139. This SQL statement needs to operate
--         across all of the raw data to find the right subset of transactions.
--         To enable this type of analysis while preventing the user who is
--         performing the analysis from seeing the raw data, we wrap this SQL
--         statement in a secure UDF and add an input parameter to specify the
--         item number we are selecting for market basket analysis, as follows:

-- PROVIDER --
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURE FUNCTION CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC.GET_MARKET_BASKET(INPUT_ITEM_SK NUMBER(38))
RETURNS TABLE (INPUT_ITEM NUMBER(38,0), BASKET_ITEM_SK NUMBER(38,0),NUM_BASKETS NUMBER(38,0))
AS
 'SELECT INPUT_ITEM_SK
       , SS_ITEM_SK BASKET_ITEM
       , COUNT(DISTINCT SS_TICKET_NUMBER) BASKETS
    FROM CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC.SALES
    WHERE SS_TICKET_NUMBER IN (SELECT SS_TICKET_NUMBER FROM CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC.SALES WHERE SS_ITEM_SK = INPUT_ITEM_SK)
GROUP BY SS_ITEM_SK
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 2';

SELECT * FROM TABLE(CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC.GET_MARKET_BASKET(6139));
-- PROVIDER --

--         We can then call this function and specify any item number as an
--         input, and we will get the same results we received when running the
--         SQL statement directly. Now, we can grant a specified user access to
--         this function while preventing the user from accessing the underlying
--         transactional data.

-- 17.7.3  How To Share Secure UDFs
--         To share a secure UDF, we can then grant usage rights on the secure
--         UDF to a Snowflake share. This gives other specified Snowflake
--         accounts the ability to run the secure UDF, but does not grant any
--         access rights to the data in the underlying tables.

-- PROVIDER --

-- PROVIDER --


-- 17.7.4  Create database from share and run query on the data consumer.
--         Perform this step on the [consumer-account] in browser 2.
--         We can run the secure UDF from the share using the second accountâ€™s
--         virtual warehouse. However, from the second account, we cannot select
--         any data from the underlying tables, determine anything about the
--         names or structures of the underlying tables, or see the code behind
--         the secure UDF.

-- 17.7.5  Examine Share from the data provider.
--         Perform this step on the [provider-account] in browser 1.

-- PROVIDER --
DESCRIBE SHARE CHIPMUNK_UDF_DEMO_SHARE;
-- PROVIDER --

--         The secure UDF is essentially using the data access rights of its
--         creator, but allowing itself to be run by another Snowflake account
--         that has access rights to run it. With Snowflake Data Sharing, the
--         compute processing for secure UDFs runs in the context of, and is
--         paid for by, the data consumer using the consumerâ€™s virtual
--         warehouse, against the function providerâ€™s single encrypted copy of
--         the underlying data.
--         This ability to share a secure UDF enables a myriad of secure data
--         sharing and data monetization use cases, including the ability to
--         share raw and aggregated data and powerful analytical functions,
--         while also protecting the secure UDFâ€™s code. It also prevents other
--         parties from directly viewing or exporting the underlying encrypted
--         data.
